# JS Mastery React Native Aora

This project was made following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCUegTZF7M&ab_channel=JavaScriptMastery) from JS Mastery on YouTube. I made minimal changes to the project, but chose to use TypeScript instead of JavaScript. This is my first React Native project. Using NativeWind made this project an easy transition from my previous work with React and Tailwind.
